/**
 * 4. Fat Gram Calculator
 * Write a program that asks for the number of calories and fat grams in a food.
 * The program should display the percentage of calories that come from fat.
 * If the calories from fat are less than 30% of the total calories of the food,
 * it should also display a message indicating that the food is low in fat.
 * One gram of fat has 9 calories, so Calories from fat = fat grams * 9
 * The percentage of calories from fat can be calculated as: Calories from fat รท total calories
 * Input Validation: Make sure the number of calories and fat grams are not less than 0.
 * Also, the number of calories from fat cannot be greater than the total number of calories.
 * If that happens, display an error message indicating that either the calories or fat
 * grams were incorrectly entered.
